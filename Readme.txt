1. Design Considerations

I used TDD for the design of the program so as to ensure testability of the various components/modules/classes and I also implemented extension classes and methods.

I subdivided the solution into 3 projects;
- Common, which hosts common and/or shared utilities.
- Root, which hosts the console app.
- Tests, which hosts the various unit tests.

2. Instruction(s)

- Set the Root (Console) project as Startup Project
- Open the projects Properties settings
- Go to Debug > Command line arguments and provided the arguments as per below;
